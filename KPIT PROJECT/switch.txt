The switch statement is often faster than nested if...else (not always). Also, the syntax of switch statement is c leaner and easy to understand.

Syntax of switch...case
switch (n)
{
    case constant1:
        // code to be executed if n is equal to constant1;
        break;

    case constant2:
        // code to be executed if n is equal to constant2;
        break;
        .
        .
        .
    default:
        // code to be executed if n doesn't match any constant
}
When a case constant is found that matches the switch expression, control of the program passes to the block of code associated with that case.

The break statement is used to prevent the code running into the next case.
