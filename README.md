CODE RACK:

CODE RACK is a simple C project that prompts the user to learn C- programming.  The program uses basic C concept such as functions, switch case, string manipulations and looping statements for implementation. The program consists of text readable functions to read all the related files for the project execution. 
                    It includes welcome page,main menu and other options. The program calls 23 external text files for execution purpose and the program won’t run without that 23 text files. So while executing the project the 23 text files which are attached to the Github URL must be externally linked to the program running environment. 
The main menu allows the user to select the topic which he/she wishes to learn. All the concepts are both theoretical and also designed in code executable format for the clear understanding of concepts. 
The project covers the basic concepts such as keywords, identifiers, Looping statements, conditional statements, unconditional statements and an overview about what is array and functions along with a sample code for each concepts. 
At last the project includes a mock test (MCQ type) to test the user’s understanding over the project. The mock score determines the user’s knowledge about C-Programming .Itis a simple attempt made in an application point of view for the people who are struggling to learn programming in the coding era.
